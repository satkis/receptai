    "description": "Algerian Mint Tea (Atay Djazairi) is an Algerian drink. Mint tea is a popular drink all over North Africa and its preparation varies from one country to another. Algerian Mint Tea is prepared by boiling dried green tea and fresh mint leaves in water and sugar. It is poured in small glass cups from very high to allow the hot water to oxygenate, the tea to develop its aromas and to obtain a fine foam on top of the drink.",

      "1 bunch of fresh mint leaves",
      "10 sugar cubes (optional)",
