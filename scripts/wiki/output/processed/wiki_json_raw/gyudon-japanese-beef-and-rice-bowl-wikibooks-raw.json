    "description": "Gyudon, often literally translated as 'beef bowl', is a Japanese dish consisting of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. It also often includes shirataki noodles. Gyudon is a very popular food in Japan, and it is commonly served with beni shōga (pickled ginger), shichimi seasoning, and a side dish of miso soup. Gyū means \"cow\" or \"beef\", and don is short for donburi, the Japanese word for \"bowl\".",
