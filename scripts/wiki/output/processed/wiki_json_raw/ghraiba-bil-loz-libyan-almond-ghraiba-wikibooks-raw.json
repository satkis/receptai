    "description": "Ghreyba bil loz is a delicious Libyan almond cookie loved for its delicate texture and rich almond flavor. These cookies are often enjoyed during festive occasions and are a popular treat in Libyan cuisine. Ghreyba bil loz melts in your mouth and is perfect for serving with a cup of tea or coffee.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup butter, softened",
      "½ cup powdered sugar",
      "2 cups all-purpose flour",
      "½ cup finely ground almonds",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
      "Whole almonds, for decoration"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.",
      "In a mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and powdered sugar until light and fluffy.",
      "Add the flour, ground almonds, and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Mix until well combined and a soft dough forms.",
      "Pinch off small portions of the dough and roll them into balls about the size of a walnut. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between them.",
      "Press a whole almond into the center of each cookie ball, gently flattening the cookies slightly.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown.",
      "Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Ghribia bil loz are delicate and crumbly, so handle them gently when transferring to the wire rack.",
      "The cookies will firm up as they cool, so don't worry if they seem soft right out of the oven.",
      "Make sure the butter is softened at room temperature to easily cream it with the powdered sugar.",
      "If you prefer a more pronounced almond flavor, you can add a few drops of almond extract to the dough along with the vanilla extract.",
      "For a touch of citrus, add the zest of 1 lemon or orange to the dough.",
      "Dust the cooled cookies with a sprinkle of powdered sugar for an elegant presentation."
