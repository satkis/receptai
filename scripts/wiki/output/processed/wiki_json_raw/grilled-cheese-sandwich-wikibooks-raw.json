    "description": "A grilled cheese sandwich is a simple hot sandwich filled with melted cheese. The key variable is the ratio of cheese to bread; this depends on the thickness and density of the bread, and the amount of cheese used, and varies according to taste; generally more cheese is preferred, so that the bread doesn't overwhelm the cheese. The goal is to get a nicely browned sandwich with melted cheese in the middle.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 slices of bread",
      "Butter",
      "1–3 slices of easy-to-melt cheese, such as cheddar, gouda, Limberger, American (or shredded cheese to taste)",
      "Other ingredients as necessary (see variations below)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Heat a skillet, frying pan or griddle over medium heat.",
      "Spread butter on the bread, and place both pieces of bread, butter side down, in the skillet.",
      "When the butter sides of both have browned (check periodically), flip one over and place cheese on top, then place the other slice of bread on top of the cheese (again, butter side down).",
      "Compress the sandwich by pressing on it with a spatula.",
      "Once the bottom side of the sandwich is browned sufficiently, flip the sandwich over. When both sides are browned, take off heat, cut, and serve.",
      "Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F).",
      "Spread butter on both sides of the bread slices.",
      "Sandwich the cheese and fillings between the bread slices, and transfer the sandwiches to a baking sheet.",
      "Bake for 10–15 minutes, flip, and bake another 5–10 minutes or to taste."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Try spreading both sides of the bread with mayonnaise, mustard, barbecue sauce, ketchup, and/or aioli.",
      "Try layering other ingredients with sliced cheese, such as ham, tomato, shredded cooked pork, salami, etc.",
      "If using shredded cheese, try mixing in various ingredients such as diced onion, garlic, leeks, shallots, pickles, crumbled bacon, pepper, thyme, cumin, etc.",
      "Kappacasein of Borough Market uses cheddar cheese and sourdough bread, and mixes in onions, leek, and garlic. The bread is sliced ~6–8 mm thick and cooked in a flat sandwich press until the entire surface is crisp.",
      "It is common practice at the Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation in Pearson, WI to substitute a garlic-flavored spread for the butter.",
      "You can also make open-faced baked sandwiches; in these, the exposed cheese tends to puff and bubble. If you only heat from above (via radiant heat), you will melt the cheese and leave the bread untoasted or lightly toasted, which may be desired; however, you should generally heat from both sides.",
      "To get evenly melted cheese, and avoid burnt bread, cook over low heat on the stove—this gives the cheese time to warm up and melt, rather than scorching the bread before the cheese warms up.",
      "Margarine can be used instead of butter, but it is not recommended, as direct heating tends to negatively affect the taste of margarine.",
      "Using a specialized sandwich maker is useful as it circumvents the need to flip, provides attractive browning marks, and seals in the sandwich.",
      "If you prefer soggy bread, melt the butter in a pan, and grill or roast in that. If you prefer crisp bread, spread butter on the bread, and toast on a grate or cook in a ridged indoor grill, so the fat runs away."
