    "description": "This recipe adapts the classic Canadian dessert recipes, Nanaimo Bars. The traditional version of these bars use a lot of sugar and saturated fats through shredded coconut and butter. This version replaces the coconut in the base with rolled oats and sunflower seeds. The sugary custard layer is replaced with a lightly sweetened greek yogurt layer.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup graham cracker crumbs",
      "1 cup rolled oats",
      "½ cup sunflower seeds chopped to medium coarseness",
      "½ cup chopped walnuts",
      "¼ cup cocoa powder",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",
      "2 tablespoons canola oil",
      "¼ cup honey",
      "1 egg, beaten",
      "1 oz dark chocolate, melted",
      "¼ cup brown sugar",
      "2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened",
      "1 cup skyr or Greek yogurt",
      "2 tbsp maple syrup",
      "2 tbsp custard powder (or substitute 2 tbsp of corn starch and 1 tsp of vanilla extract)",
      "4 oz dark chocolate, finely chopped",
      "In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with honey, canola oil, and dark chocolate. Stir until smooth.",
      "Remove from heat, then add the oats, sunflower seeds, walnuts, cocoa powder, and beaten egg. Mix until fully combined.",
      "Press mixture firmly into a parchment-lined 8x8 inch pan. Chill for 15 minutes.",
      "In a bowl, cream the butter until light. Add powdered sugar, maple syrup, milk, and custard powder. Beat until smooth and fluffy.",
      "Spread evenly over the chilled base. Return to the fridge for 20 minutes.",
      "Sprinkle the finely chopped chocolate evenly on top of the middle layer",
      "For best results, allow the dish to set by sitting in the fridge for 8 hours (overnight). To serve, cut into bars using a sharp knife dipped in warm water for clean edges.",
      "Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.",
      "For a stronger maple flavor, use dark maple syrup in the middle layer."
