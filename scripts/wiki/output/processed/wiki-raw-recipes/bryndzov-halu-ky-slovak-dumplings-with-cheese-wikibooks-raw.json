    "description": "Bryndzové halušky is a Slovak dumpling dish. The ingredient that makes this national dish of Slovakia a favorite is the sheep's milk cheese, which has a slightly sharper taste than the non-flavored goat cheese spread available at many US grocery stores. The most abundant ingredient is the raw potato, which comprises most of the dough that creates the halušky and is a major staple in the Slovak diet.",
    "ingredients": [
      "750 g potatoes, peeled and finely grated",
      "Salt (optional)",
      "250 g all-purpose flour (hladkej múky)",
      "250 g bryndze cheese, cut into very small pieces",
      "100 g bacon (údenej slaniny), cooked and cut into small pieces"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Combine the grated potatoes with with the flour and salt to make a dough.",
      "Shape the dough into small cylindrical pieces less than 3 cm in size.",
      "Transfer the dumplings to a pot of boiling salted water. When the dumplings rise to the top of the boiling water, remove one to make sure they are thoroughly cooked.",
      "Remove the dumplings from the pot with a slotted spoon, and transfer to a warmed plate.",
      "Immediately after dumplings are placed on the plate, scatter the cheese over top, and let the cheese melt over the dumplings. Mix if desired.",
      "Sprinkle the crispy bacon bits on top of the cheese.",
      "Serve piping hot."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "If in a hurry, try replacing the from-scratch halusky with store-bought potato gnocchi.",
      "If unable to find bryndze, you can substitute crumbled goat cheese or one of several types of crumbled feta. Some feta are stronger-flavored, which is preferable here."
