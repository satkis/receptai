    "description": "The original contributor provided the following anecdote:<blockquote>\"On a recent trip to the Caribbean I was impressed by all the roadside Barbecue stops that spring up on weekends, where you can buy, very cheaply, a portion of chicken, usually in a good, if rather sticky barbecue sauce, to take away and eat on a wonderful beach somewhere! I jokingly suggested to one enterprising young man, that he also offer chicken marinaded in coconut, herbs and spices as an alternative. He tried it and told me that evening that he had had almost more customers for this recipe, than for his barbecued chicken. It may become all the rage in the future!! It certainly is delicious!\"</blockquote>",
    "ingredients": [
      "Skin-on chicken legs, breasts, or wings (sufficient for the number of people you are cooking for)",
      "1 tin (400 ml) coconut milk",
      "1 lime, zested and juiced",
      "1 bunch fresh mint, chopped",
      "1 large sprinkle of paprika",
      "1 pinch of salt",
      "1 small knob of fresh ginger, grated",
      "1 cupful of basmati rice per person",
      "10 g butter (optional)",
      "3 cloves"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Stab the chicken in various places to a depth of about ½ inch so that they take on the taste from the marinade.",
      "Combine all the contents of the marinade together in a dish, and place the chicken into it so that the chicken is covered by the marinade. Let marinate, turning occasionally, for at least 3 hours, or overnight is possible—the longer the better.",
      "Place the chicken pieces on a barbecue, an electric grill, or even in the oven. Cook until done, making sure you coat the chicken with plenty of the marinade as you cook. You should aim for a nice crispy skin.",
      "In a large saucepan bring some salted water to a boil, and add the cloves.",
      "Add the rice, and boil until the rice is cooked. Drain and rinse under hot water to remove excess starch. Take out the cloves and discard.",
      "Return the rice to the pan and place over a low heat. Add about ½ cupful of the coconut marinade mixture (or any leftover coconut milk from the tin) to the rice, and heat through slowly.",
      "Add the butter at the last minute, and let it melt. If there is any left over, also add a handful of the chopped mint leaves to the rice as well.",
      "Fluff up the rice with a fork.",
      "Place rice in the middle of your serving plate, place the grilled/barbecued chicken on top, sprinkle with a squeeze of fresh lime juice, and serve with a green salad."

      "You can roast some bananas in the same oven to go with this, either in their skins, or in foil with a little cinnamon!"
