Strain the mixture and discard the solids. # Combine the rice flour and pandan liquid in a bowl, and knead well to make a dough. # Pinch off pieces of the dough, and roll them into balls. They should be about 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) in diameter. # Use your hands to flatten a ball or create a small pocket in the center, making space for a piece of the sugar. Place a piece of sugar in the center, then pinch the dough closed around the sugar. # Gently roll the filled dumpling into a ball again. # Repeat the filling and shaping process for all of the dough pieces. # Bring 2 L water to a boil in a deep pot. # Add the dumplings to the pot, working in batches if needed to avoid crowding the pan. Boil until the dumplings rise to the surface—don't boil too hard, as you don't want to burst the dumplings. # Remove and drain the dumplings. # While still hot, roll the cooked dumplings in the plate of coconut until they are completely coated.",
