    "notes": [
      "If you do not know how to use a chimney starter, use a gas grill, or believe the people who sell sickening solvent that they light by being soaked in a chemical, this is how you do it. First, wad up a sheet of newspaper and moisten it with 1–2 tsp vegetable oil. Place it in the bottom compartment, and place your coals in the top compartment. Light, go grab a beer, and wait until the coals are covered with a grey ash, about 15 minutes on good weather. Disperse and cook."
