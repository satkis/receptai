    "description": "Filipino-style spaghetti is a favorite among Filipino families for serving during children's birthday parties.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 tbsp vegetable oil",
      "300 g (10.5 oz) canned hot dogs, sliced",
      "2 onions, finely chopped",
      "1 tsp sea salt",
      "4 garlic cloves, minced",
      "500 g (1 lb) pork mince",
      "2½ tbsp tomato paste",
      "1 cup banana ketchup",
      "700 g (1 lb 8 oz) tomato purée (you could also try sourcing the Filipino spaghetti sauce, although that will be sweeter)",
      "½ cup chicken stock",
      "2½ tbsp soy sauce",
      "600 g (1 lb 5 oz) dried spaghetti",
      "1 cup grated cheddar cheese, or to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Heat the vegetable oil in the pan over medium-high heat.",
      "Add the hot dogs, then cook, turning often, for 3–4 minutes until browned.",
      "Transfer hot dogs to a plate using a slotted spoon, leaving the oil behind.",
      "Add the onion into the hot oil, along with the salt. Cook, stirring, for 5–6 minutes or until the onion is lovely and soft.",
      "Add the garlic and cook for a minute until aromatic.",
      "Add the pork mince, breaking it up with your spatula. Keep cooking until the pork has evenly cooked.",
      "Add the tomato paste. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute to cook it down slightly.",
      "Return the cooked hot dogs to the pan, along with the banana ketchup, tomato sauce, chicken stock, and soy sauce. Stir to combine well.",
      "Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring often, for 10–15 minutes so the flavours develop. Take care as the mixture can easily burn.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a pot of boiling salted water according to packet directions until al dente. Drain and add back into the warm pot that you cooked the pasta in.",
      "Spoon a few heaped spoonfuls of the cooked sauce over the pasta, then mix so that each spaghetti strand is coated.",
      "Divide pasta among serving bowls and top with more of the sauce.",
      "Top with grated cheddar and serve."
