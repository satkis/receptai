    "description": "Daifukumochi (大福餅), or Daifuku (大福) (literally \"great luck\"), is a Japanese confection consisting of a small round mochi (glutinous rice cake) stuffed with sweet filling, most commonly anko, sweetened red bean paste made from azuki beans.",
    "ingredients": [
      "Anko filling",
      "~½ cup potato starch (katakuriko)",
      "1 cup sweet glutinous rice flour (mochiko)",
      "⅔ cup water",
      "¼ cup white granulated sugar"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare anko filling as directed. Shape into 12 small, marble-sized balls and set aside.",
      "Prepare a smooth surface, such as a cutting board, by coating with potato starch; be generous, as the dough will be very sticky.",
      "Heat water and sugar together in a microwave until sugar is dissolved. Add rice flour and stir completely. Microwave for 2 minutes, remove and stir. Microwave for 2 more minutes, or until dough begins to expand. Remove from microwave, stir again, and remove the dough to the potato starch-coated surface. The dough, called mochi, will be very hot.",
      "Spread or roll the mochi dough out until thin. Using a knife, cut into 12 even sized pieces.",
      "Coat the palms and fingers of your hands in potato starch. Spread each piece out as thin as possible.",
      "Place an anko ball in the middle of each mochi piece, then wrap the mochi around the ball, forming a bigger ball.",
      "Roll shaped daifuku in potato starch, and set on a plate dusted with potato starch or a piece of wax paper.",
      "Serve warm or cool. Store in an airtight container. Very perishable."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Chocolate ganache may be substituted for anko paste.",
      "Food coloring may be added to the water before the rice flour is mixed in.",
      "Cocoa powder may be used instead of potato starch in the final step."
