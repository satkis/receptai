    "notes": [
      "Using 3 identical cake pans instead of 1 large one is acceptable.",
      "Margarine, vegetable oil or regular butter will substitute for Irish butter.",
      "In some countries (e.g. Austria and Australia) the brandy is often replaced by rum, in Germany itself it is almost always replaced by Kirschwasser.",
      "Cakes usually work at between 325°F and 400°F (160°C and 205°C). Pastries usually work at between 350°F and 425°F (175°C and 220°C)."
