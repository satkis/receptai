    "description": "__NOTOC__ A Fribourg omelet is a mix of eggs, crunchy greens, and ham, with the Swiss canton of Fribourg’s native Gruyère cheese adding an acidic punch to bind the flavors together. ==Ingredients== *4 large eggs *1 pinch salt *1 pinch ground black pepper *2 tbsp milk *1 pinch ground nutmeg *2 tbsp butter or olive oil *3 thin slices of ham, cut in small squares * 1 handful roughly chopped fresh kale * 6 thin 8-cm (3-inch)-wide slices of Gruyère cheese",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 large eggs",
      "1 pinch salt",
      "1 pinch ground black pepper",
      "2 tbsp milk",
      "1 pinch ground nutmeg",
      "2 tbsp butter or olive oil",
      "3 thin slices of ham, cut in small squares",
      "1 handful roughly chopped fresh kale",
      "6 thin 8-cm (3-inch)-wide slices of Gruyère cheese"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, pepper, milk and nutmeg, until even and glossy.",
      "Place half the butter in the skillet on medium heat. Swirl the pan to coat evenly with butter.",
      "Add ham and cook until deep brown.",
      "Stir in kale for 30 seconds, or until slightly wilted but still crunchy. Set aside the ham and greens.",
      "Add the remainder of the butter to the skillet over low heat.",
      "Pour egg mixture into the skillet, moving skillet to create a flat, even layer. Heat until the eggs have begun to set, with some fluff on top.",
      "Scatter the ham and kale evenly over the top of the eggs.",
      "Lay the Gruyère slices over the open omelet. Heat until the edges of the cheese have melted slightly.",
      "Gently push the edges of the omelet less than half a centimeter toward the center of the skillet with two spatulas, making sure not to break it. Turn the heat off.",
      "Use the spatulas to lift half the omelet and fold over the other half. Move the entire omelet carefully onto a plate and serve."
