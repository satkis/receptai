      "Press into the bottom of an 8-inch (20 cm) loose-bottomed pie tin, and transfer to the fridge to chill.",
      "Place the remaining butter with the sugar into a medium-sized saucepan (ideally non-stick if you don't like dish washing). Melt over a medium heat, stirring until the butter has melted and the sugar is just starting to melt.",
      "Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring continuously for 5 minutes to make your caramel.",
      "Slice the bananas, arrange over the crumb base, and pour the caramel over the top.",
      "Chill for at least an hour so the caramel firms up.",
      "Prior to serving, whip the cream, and spoon over the top. Optionally, garnish with some grated chocolate or Cape gooseberries."
