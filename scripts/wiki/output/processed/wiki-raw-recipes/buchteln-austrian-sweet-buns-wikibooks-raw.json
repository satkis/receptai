To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.75% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1% active dry yeast, although you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat. Further reductions will reduce yeast flavor even more, and those same reductions will result in longer times to rise during bulk ferment.</ref>",

Whole milk is about 88% water. 41% ÷ 88% ≈ 46.59%. Thus, baker's % whole milk value should be somewhere around the value of 47%. Values to try would be in the approximate range of 37-57%. </ref>",
