    "description": "__NOTOC__ | Austrian Cuisine Frittaten soup originates from an incident that took place during the Congress of Vienna in the 19th century, which involved various European ambassadors and was chaired by the Austrian Prince, Klemens Wenzel von Metternich. At this time, the main issues of European politics were discussed during secret meetings between the key diplomats. These private meetings needed to be kept confidential, and many ambassadors decided to hold them incognito in inns outside of the city.",
