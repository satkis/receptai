    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (240 ml) milk",
      "1 cup + 2 Tablespoons (200 g + 25 g) granulated sugar",
      "2 teaspoons (10 g) butter",
      "¼ teaspoon salt",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla sugar",
      "4 eggs, separated",
      "2 Tablespoons (15 g) cornstarch",
      "14–20 vanilla wafers or ladyfingers",
      "¼ cup (60 ml) lemon juice",
      "2 ripe bananas",
      "1 Tablespoon (10 g) shredded unsweetened coconut"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a saucepan, stir together the milk, 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, butter, salt, and vanilla extract and cook over medium heat until the butter melts.",
      "Whisk the egg yolks in a separate container (a coffee mug will do), then whisk two tablespoons of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks to temper them so they don’t curdle.",
      "When the egg mixture is smooth, whisk it into the milk mixture.",
      "Add 2 tablespoons of cold water to the cornstarch and stir until smooth; then whisk it into the milk mixture and cook until thickened, stirring constantly so it doesn’t burn.",
      "Remove the custard from heat.",
      "Whip the egg whites and 2 Tablespoons (25 g) sugar in a bowl until stiff peaks form.",
      "Cut the bananas into thin slices (about ¼ inch or 5 mm thick).",
      "In a large bowl with a flat bottom, place a layer of vanilla wafers or ladyfingers on the bottom.",
      "Pour half of the lemon juice and spread half of the custard over these, then layer half of the banana slices on top of the custard.",
      "Add another layer of cookies, the rest of the lemon juice, the rest of the custard, and the rest of the banana slices.",
      "Top with the meringue and sprinkle the coconut on top.",
      "Refrigerate for several hours before serving."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "If you'd rather make the custard using a custard powder, that's fine, but you won't have leftover egg whites to make the meringue with. In this case, you can replace the meringue with whipped cream."
