    "description": "Faten wake is a traditional Hausa bean porridge from Northern Nigeria. This hearty and nutritious dish is made with soft-cooked beans, vegetables, and spices, and it is typically served as a main meal for lunch or dinner. It can be enjoyed on its own or with sides like bread, fried plantains, or pap.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups dried beans (black-eyed peas or brown beans)",
      "Water (enough to cook the beans)",
      "1 medium onion, chopped",
      "2–3 fresh tomatoes, chopped",
      "1–2 Scotch bonnet chiles or chile powder to taste",
      "1–2 tablespoons groundnut oil or palm oil",
      "1 small bunch of leafy greens, such as spinach, sorrel, ugu, amaranth, or bitterleaf, chopped (optional)",
      "1–2 seasoning cubes (optional)",
      "Salt, to taste",
      "Ground crayfish (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Rinse the beans thoroughly, removing any dirt or stones.",
      "Place the beans in a pot, cover with enough water, and simmer over medium heat until soft and the water is almost absorbed (about 40–60 minutes).",
      "Add chopped onions, tomatoes, chile, and oil to the cooked beans. Stir and allow to simmer for 10–15 minutes, until the mixture thickens and the flavors combine.",
      "Stir in chopped leafy vegetables, ground crayfish, seasoning cubes, and salt. Continue cooking for another 5–10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the porridge thickens and is well blended.",
      "Serve hot."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "If using brown beans, you may need a slightly longer cooking time than for black-eyed peas.",
      "Palm oil gives a more traditional taste, while groundnut oil offers a lighter flavor.",
      "Adding crayfish enhances the savory taste, especially if no meat is used."
