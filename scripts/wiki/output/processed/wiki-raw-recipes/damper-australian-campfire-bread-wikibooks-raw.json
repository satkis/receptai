    "ingredients": [
      "1 large cup self-raising flour",
      "1 generous pinch salt",
      "scant ¼ cup water (more and it will be as tough as an old boot)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Add salt to flour.",
      "Add water, then mix and form into a round loaf.",
      "Dig a 1 foot-deep hole near a fire, and fill it with 2 shovels of hot coals and ash.",
      "Add damper mixture to a greased camp oven (traditional cast iron round pot with lid).",
      "Cook in the hole for a maximum of 40 minutes. If undercooked it will be flat and rubbery.",
      "Your first try may be inedible. Keep trying, you'll soon be an expert."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "This cookbook also has a Drover's damper recipe.",
      "You can do this in a barbecue grill with the mixture in greased metal foil as well. During cooking, damper increases in volume by ⅓ to ½, so allow room for expansion.",
      "If you aren't outdoors, just add mixture to greased oven tray and bake in a moderate oven for 30–40 minutes."
