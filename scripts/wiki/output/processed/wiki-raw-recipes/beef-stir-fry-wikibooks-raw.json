    "description": "Beef Stir-Fry is a flavorful dish that combines thin slices of beef with vegetables and spicy aromatics, perfect for serving over rice or noodles.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 (6–8 oz / 170–225 g) ribeye steak, sliced thinly across the grain on a bias",
      "Salt, to taste",
      "Freshly-ground black pepper",
      "2 tbsp soy sauce",
      "1–2 Thai bird chilis, finely minced",
      "1 tbsp minced garlic",
      "½ large onion, finely diced",
      "Peanut (groundnut) oil, for frying",
      "½ large carrot, peeled and julienned",
      "¼ cup scallions, julienned",
      "2 tbsp honey",
      "1 tbsp rice wine vinegar",
      "1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Lightly oil the bottom of a wok or large skillet and preheat over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring, until the garlic turns golden. Remove from the pan and keep warm.",
      "Sprinkle the beef slices with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add 4 slices to the hot wok and stir-fry until well browned and no longer pink. Remove and repeat with the remaining beef.",
      "Add chilis, carrots, soy sauce, honey, vinegar, and scallions to the wok. Stir-fry until the vegetables are lightly browned around the edges.",
      "Return the cooked onion, garlic, and beef to the wok. Toss together until heated through.",

    ],
    "notes": [
      "You may substitute Thai bird chilis with serrano peppers or crushed red pepper flakes for a milder heat.",
      "Ribeye steak is flavorful and tender, but flank steak or sirloin can be used as leaner alternatives.",
      "Adjust the balance of soy sauce and honey depending on your preference for salty vs. sweet.",
      "Ensure beef is sliced thinly against the grain for tenderness."
