    "ingredients": [
      "Self-rising flour",
      "Milk or buttermilk plus ⅛ tsp baking soda",
      "Bacon fat"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Mix equal amounts of self-rising flour and milk. The mixture should be the consistency of thick pudding—add more milk or flour to desired consistency.",
      "Heat enough bacon fat to prevent sticking in an iron skillet until it is very hot.",
      "Fry spoonfuls of dough in the skillet until brown and crispy on the bottom. Turn and continue frying until done."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Other oils and types of skillets can be used for frying, but bacon fat and an iron skillet makes the best. A mixture of ½ bacon fat and ½ olive oil is an acceptable substitute."
