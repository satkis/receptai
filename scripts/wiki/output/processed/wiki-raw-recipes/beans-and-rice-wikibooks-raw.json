    "description": "This recipe for beans and rice is great to make on the weekend and bring to work during the week. It's also great for entertaining on a budget, since you can feed 5 or 6 people for less than ten dollars. It is a vegan adaptation of cajun rice and beans, similar to gallo pinto.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 package (16 oz) dry beans (kidney or black beans preferred)",
      "1 onion, chopped",
      "1 green bell pepper, chopped",
      "1 celery stalk, sliced thin",
      "1 bulb garlic, minced",
      "2 bay leaves",
      "1 tsp ground cumin",
      "1 tsp chili powder",
      "1 tsp ground basil",
      "Olive oil",
      "Salt to taste",
      "Pepper, to taste",
      "1–2 whole dried or fresh hot peppers (optional)",
      "1–2 cups rice"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Soak beans overnight, or, bring to a boil and let sit for one hour.",
      "In a Dutch oven or large pot, sauté onions and garlic in olive oil on medium heat until onions are translucent.",
      "Add green pepper and celery, and sauté for a few minutes more.",
      "Add beans and enough water to cover all ingredients.",
      "Add spices, then bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until done (1–2 hours, depending on the age of your beans).",
      "Add rice and twice as much water to a pot (i.e. 1 cup rice + 2 cups water).",
      "Bring to a rolling boil, and cook until the water has boiled down to the level of the rice.",
      "Reduce heat to a light simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.",
      "Serve the beans over the rice and enjoy! It is also very tasty with cornbread."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "You can use canned beans instead of dry. This greatly reduces cooking time, but doesn't allow for the flavor to soak into the beans as well.",
      "To make this in a crockpot, sauté the vegetables in a pan, then add all ingredients (except rice) to the crockpot and cook on low for 6-8 hours.",
      "You can make this in an Instant Pot or pressure cooker."
