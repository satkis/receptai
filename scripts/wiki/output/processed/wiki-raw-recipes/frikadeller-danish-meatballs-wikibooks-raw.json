    "description": "Frikadeller are as Danish as the Dannebrog. This is standard Danish fare, made of ground pork and veal and traditionally served with boiled potatoes, gravy and rødkål (braised red cabbage). Originally, this dish was made so that the meat would feed more people, and thus, the possibilities as to what can be added are numerous.",
