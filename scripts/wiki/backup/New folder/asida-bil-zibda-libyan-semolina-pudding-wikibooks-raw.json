      "1 teaspoon ground cardamom",
      "1 cup milk",

    "instructions": [
      "In a large pot or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.",
      "Add the semolina to the pot and cook, stirring continuously, for about 10 minutes, or until it turns golden brown and gives off a nutty aroma.",
      "Reduce the heat to low and add the sugar and ground cardamom to the pot. Mix well to combine.",
      "Gradually pour in the milk while stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.",
      "Continue to cook the mixture, stirring continuously, for about 10–15 minutes, or until it thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pot. The consistency should be smooth and creamy.",
      "Remove the pot from the heat and cool slightly.",

      "Feel free to add a touch of rose water or orange blossom water to the mixture for a fragrant twist.",
