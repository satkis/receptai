    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup split yellow moong dal",
      "3 cups water",
      "2 cups granulated sugar",
      "12 tablespoons ghee, divided",
      "4 tablespoons wheat flour",
      "¼ teaspoon cardamom powder",
      "3 tablespoons broken cashews",
      "1 pinch red food colouring in 1 teaspoon water"
    ],
